# FinalBurn Neo for macOS

## Download
[Version 1.0](https://github.com/fbn-mac/FBNeo/releases/tag/macos-v1.0) is the
latest stable release. [View all releases](https://github.com/fbn-mac/FBNeo/releases).

## Compatibility
Emulator has been tested successfully on High Sierra and above, though it's very
likely that it may run on earlier versions (perhaps as low as Mountain Lion). If you
can build and run successfully on an earlier version of macOS (OS X?), let me know.

## Use
Launch any set by dropping it on the app's icon or in the window. You can also
use `File/Open` and `File/Open Recent`. ROMs can reside anywhere, though if you
load a game that requires files from a parent set or BIOS (e.g. Neo-Geo),
the files are expected to be in the same directory. Supported archives
are `zip` and `7z`.

## Input
Currently supported input devices are keyboard (using standard FinalBurn layout)
and mouse.

## Known issues
* Joysticks are currently unsupported
