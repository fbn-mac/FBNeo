# FinalBurn Neo for macOS

## Download
[Version 1.03](https://github.com/fbn-mac/FBNeo/releases/tag/macos-v1.03) is the
latest stable release. [View all releases](https://github.com/fbn-mac/FBNeo/releases).

## Compatibility
OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and above

## Use
Drop a set into the Launcher window to import it, double-click to start it.
Supported archive formats are  `zip` and `7z`.

You can also use `File/Open` and `File/Open Recent` to load ROMs directly.
Files can reside anywhere, though when loading a game that requires a parent set
or BIOS (e.g. Neo-Geo), the files are expected to be in the same directory.

If a game refuses to start, check the Log Viewer (Window/Log Viewer)
for diagnostic information.

## Input
Currently supported input devices are keyboard (using standard FinalBurn layout)
and mouse.

## Known issues
* Joysticks are currently unsupported
